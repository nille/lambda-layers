# Security policy

I really don't have one, except that I do my best to take security into consideration. Please do your own due diligence
and assessment on whether you are comfortable running this code as is. If not, feel free to open a pull request with any
security improvements you would like to have incorporated. Or raise an issue.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you've found a security vulnerability, you can disclose it responsibly by sending a summary to 
security@nille.dev. I will review the potential threat and fix it as fast as I can.

I am incredibly thankful for people who disclose vulnerabilities, unfortunately I do not have a bounty program in place
as I am just a solo developer and this is a side-project of mine.

Thanks for helping support this project. I care a lot about keeping all my projects safe and really appreciate anyone 
reaching out.
